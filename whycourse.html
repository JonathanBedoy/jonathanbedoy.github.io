<h1 class="title-text"> Why this course?</h1>
<p class="body-text">I chose this course because I plan to be a web developer of some sort and
believe that this class will help me with the following: </p>
<ul>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>Javascript</li>
  <li>How to make sense of web development.</li>
</ul>
<section>
<p class="body-text2"> I already have some experience with HTML and javascript, but not CSS.
  Other than this I think that this class falls in line on what I would
  like to do as a career in the future.</p>
