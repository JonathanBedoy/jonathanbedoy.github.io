<h1> About me</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Jonathan Bedoy and I am a computer science
   student at California State University Fullerton. I enjoy
   watching television shows along with movies. I also play a bit
   of games in my spare time. I am on my fourth year of
   college and only need 1 more semester after this one. I am
   currently employed as an AVID tutor for a middle school near my house.</p>
