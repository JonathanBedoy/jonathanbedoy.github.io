    <p>I am always using a variation of this artstyle as a wallpaper.
       It is pleasing to look at for me. These wallpapers come in
       different color schemes. I am currently using the green one.
       Green is my favorite color.</p>

    <p>This is a television show that I am looking forward to in the near future.
      They are on their last season of the series that is based off the books,
       written by George RR. Martin. Except he never finished writing the books and
     the show has still progressed without them.</p>
